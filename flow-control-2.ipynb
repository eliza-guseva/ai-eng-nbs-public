    "# Control Flow: Advanced Loops in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous sessions, we explored conditional statements and basic `for` loops. Now, we'll dive deeper into Python's loop structures, focusing on the `while` statement and advanced loop control techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The \"while\" Statement: Dynamic Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` statement is a powerful tool for executing a block of code repeatedly based on a specific condition. Unlike `for` loops, which iterate over a predefined sequence, `while` loops are ideal for situations where the number of iterations is not known in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use a \"while\" Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider using a `while` loop in scenarios such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Condition Processing**: When you need to continue an operation until a specific condition is met\n",
    "   - Processing customer orders until inventory is depleted\n",
    "   - Waiting for user input with validation\n",
    "   - Implementing real-time monitoring systems\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interactive Applications**: Creating programs that respond to changing conditions\n",
    "   - User input validation\n",
    "   - Game loop mechanics\n",
    "   - System monitoring and auto-adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Continues executing as long as the condition remains true\n",
    "- Provides flexibility for unpredictable iteration counts\n",
    "- Requires careful condition management to prevent infinite loops\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caution**: Always ensure your `while` loop has a clear exit condition to avoid infinite recursion."

    "In this example, we use a \"while\" loop to calculate compound interest over a specified number of years. Compound interest is the interest calculated on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods.\n",

    "- Principal: The initial amount of money invested or borrowed.\n",
    "- Annual Interest Rate: The annual interest rate as a percentage.\n",
    "- Time Period: The number of years for which we want to calculate the compound interest.\n",
    "- Compounding Frequency: How often the interest is compounded per year. In this example, it's compounded annually (once a year).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We initialize the principal amount, annual interest rate, and the time period in years. For instance, we start with a principal of $1,000, an annual interest rate of 5%, and a time period of 10 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The formula for calculating compound interest is used, which is:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ![Compound Interest Formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A&space;=&space;P&space;\\left(1&space;&plus;&space;\\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt})\n",
    "\n",
    "   Where:\n",
    "   - A is the final amount.\n",
    "   - P is the principal.\n",
    "   - r is the annual interest rate.\n",
    "   - n is the number of times interest is compounded per year.\n",
    "   - t is the time in years.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We set the compounding frequency (n) to 1, indicating that the interest is compounded annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Using a \"while\" loop, we iterate over each year from 1 to the specified number of years. For each year, we calculate the compound interest based on the formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The calculated amount for each year is printed, showing how the investment grows over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to use a \"while\" loop to simulate the growth of an investment over multiple years, considering compound interest. It's a practical application of mathematics and programming for financial calculations.\n",

    "## Pass,  continue & break\n",
    "In Python, we have control flow statements that allow us to manage the flow of our programs. These statements help us make decisions, control loops, and handle various situations. Let's explore three important control flow statements: `pass`, `continue`, and `break`.[docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pass:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  The `pass` statement serves as a placeholder in Python. When you're writing code and need a statement at a certain place but don't want it to perform any action yet, you can use `pass`. It's a way of telling Python, \"I know there should be something here, but I'm not ready to write it yet.\" It's commonly used when you're designing the structure of your code and need to fill in the details later. For example, when defining a function or a class, you might use `pass` until you're ready to write the actual code inside them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Continue:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  The `continue` statement is used within loops (like `for` or `while`) to skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next one. Imagine you're iterating over a list of numbers and, when a specific condition is met, you want to skip that number and proceed to the next. You can use `continue` to achieve this. It's like saying, \"I'm done with this part of the loop; let's move to the next element.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Break:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  The `break` statement is also used within loops but is more powerful. When encountered, it immediately exits the loop, even if the loop's conditions are not met. It's like saying, \"I'm done with this loop; let's get out of here.\" You might use `break` when searching for a specific element in a list. Once you find it, you can break the loop instead of continuing to iterate unnecessarily.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **The Power of Range:** Imagine having the ability to generate sequences of numbers effortlessly, providing a structured way to control your loops. That's where the `range()` function comes into play. We'll explore how to use it to define the start, stop, and step of your sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterating Through Lists:** While iterating through a list is a common use case, we'll uncover advanced techniques. We'll learn how to access elements both by their value and by their index, allowing us to perform more complex operations efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simultaneous Looping with Zip:** Sometimes, we need to work with multiple lists or sequences in parallel. Python's `zip()` function enables us to pair corresponding elements from different sequences together, simplifying tasks that involve working with correlated data.\n",

    "- **Harnessing the Power of Dictionaries:** Dictionaries, Python's key-value stores, are versatile data structures. We'll explore how to iterate through a dictionary's keys, values, or both, providing valuable insights into how to extract and manipulate data within this structured container.\n",
